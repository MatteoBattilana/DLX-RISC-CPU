Setup LH: The signal data_in changes right before the edge of the clock and so we violate the setup time. This happens because, during the evaluation phase, we are not able to fully charge the capacitance and so the output remains 0. 

Setup HL: The signal data_in changes right before the edge of the clock and so we violate the setup time. For this reason we are not able to sample the input value correctly and so the output value is not stable.
