Setup: The signal data_in changes right before the edge of the clock and so we violate the setup time. This happens because, during the evaluation phase, we are not able to fully charge/discharge the capacitance and so the output remains at 0/1 with some oscillation during the clock edges.

Hold: Due to change in internal signals, we observe some oscillation on the output obtaining a wrong value. This is caused by not sampling the input signal correctly
