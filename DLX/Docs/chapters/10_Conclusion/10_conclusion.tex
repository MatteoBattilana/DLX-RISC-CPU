\chapter{Conclusions}
To sum up, after the Synthesis and Optimization phase, the peak frequency is 400 MHz. The generated reports highlight that the main power contribution is the dynamic one. This is due to the complex logic that has been implemented in the entire DLX. This DLX implementation has been intensively tested using complex assembly programs, starting from the arithmetic instructions to the sub-routine management.\\

The entire development has been focused on a modular approach to simplify the integration of new components and possible improvements. For example, further improvements could be the management of exceptions, a cache for the instruction and a branch target buffer.\\

All team members contributed actively and with a proactive approach to all the challenges this project brought. \\
