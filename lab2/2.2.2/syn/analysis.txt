Question 5) The analysed path are the 10 worst one. The critical path was B[0]-Y[7] and was 1.37ns. Indeed for a 32 bits implementation we found that the critical path was B[0]-Y[31] and was 4.61ns

Question 2) Now we imposed the limit of 3.688ns  (3.9ns), which is 20% less, and we obtained that the critical path is exactly 3.688ns (3.9ns). The starting and the end point of the critical path has changed and is B[1] - Y[31]. 

Question 3) The script result are equivalent. It simply adds 3 file: the post synthesis netlist in ddc, vhdl and verilog

Question 4) The results are identical. For this reason the slack is exactly 0 and the constraints are met. In fact in the file is written slack (MET). In the constrained design there are some buffers that are inserted in order to reduce the delay. AREA OPTIMIZED: 1741.502005     AREA NON OPTIMIZED: 2281.215981       The area is reduced because there are no buffers. We lost in term of area but we improve performance
